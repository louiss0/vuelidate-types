# ! This is for the vuelidate writers

## I noticed you had a hard time producing type def files for vuelidate so i found a way that you can make your own 
---

### Sorry for taking your source code but i had to make this set up 
---

## This declaration setting allows you to make a type definition file for each file in the output  

```typescript
"declaration": true,
```

The setting for compiling everything into one file 

```typescript
"tsBuildIntoFile": ""
```

## For more info look into the docs

[typescript]("https://www.typescriptlang.org/")

I'm also new to typescript so i can't do  much for you please tell me when you downloaded the code i wrote i plan on deleting the code

Oh and people normally put the type def files separately from the main library so that they can be installed separately
